# Documentation

Documentation lives in `./doc`, which is made up of markdown with
[mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/) templates. 

## Compiling Documentation

This project uses [mermaid-cli](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli) to
compile the markdown with mermaid templates.

To build the docs, run `./bin/build_docs.sh`, which compiles its output to
`./doc/output`
